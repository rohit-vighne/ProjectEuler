# Project Euler solutions

My own solutions to the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) math/computer science problems. They are by no means the optimal solutions, but reflect my own learning process and may be interesting to read.

See also: my [Haskell solutions](https://github.com/rvighne/ProjectEulerLambda) to some other Project Euler problems.
